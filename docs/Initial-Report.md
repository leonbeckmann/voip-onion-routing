#### Leon
During the last two years, I was part of a team at the Fraunhofer AISEC for developing a
secure remote-attestation protocol in Java and Rust. I have mainly be responsible for
implementing the protocol and its drivers, document the protocol, writing
some test cases and I was also part of design choices and discussions on how to construct 
the finite state machine of the protocol. 

Further, my study program is/was mainly focused on IT-Security topics. Beside lectures like
NetSec or IT-Sec, I was enrolled in the Rootkit programming lab course, were we have developed
Linux LKM-based kernel rootkits and countermeasures. As a final project, we tried to recalculate
the TLS master secret by sniffing the TLS traffic and hooking the Linux's CSPRNG, such that 
Openssl will create predictable EC Diffie-Hellman parameters for ECDHE. (programming language C)

My Bachelor Thesis was about (quantum-secure) cryptography in case of Proxy-ReEncryption schemes,
during which I learned a lot more about cryptography.
